Write down everything before you start working and get side tracked.

I am my harshest critic. My fear of failing in link to my own scolding, not that of my peers. 

> Why was I so sacred to fail?

Because I knew I wasn't scared of what my peers might say about it. What family and friends might say. I told myself I didn't give a shit what anyone else thought - and I think that is true.

But I didn't take into account what I would say if I failed. Because I know what I would say, and it would be ruthless.

Maybe there are other people out there like me:

Your own worst enemy/harshest critic/biggest rival. Maybe you arn't getting anywhere because you'll beat yourself up if you fail and make a mistake.

The real issue is for when I make a mistake. I _hate_ making mistakes. 

    When I make a mistake I almost never let it go.
    It could be meaningless, but I will beat myself up.

I hope one day I am able to make a mistake - maybe even have the out come be painful, but know I learned something. Just like the poker player that losses the pot, but maybe the right play *probabalistically*. That's what's important. Or, if you truely make a mistake, learn from it.
