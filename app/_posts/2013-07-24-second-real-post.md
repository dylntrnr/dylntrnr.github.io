Ok, so this post is being written on emacs from my t1-micro amazon instance. It's been pretty interesting to learn how to use amazon web services. I would like to learn amazon S3(?) next and be able to serve static content a little more efficently. I just realized I need to have a spell checker or something for emacs - becauase otherwise I am a terrible speller. 

If I indent four spaces I think it does something different. I think it is a code block, which means this will proably look weird.
