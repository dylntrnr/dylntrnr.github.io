So I'm not much of a writer, but I want to take my hand at writing things down that I think would be useful. 

For example I am writing this in Vim right now. I've never used Vim and it seems pretty cool. You can move around with h j k l. Go to the begining of a line with 0 and the end with $. 

I've found it useful to be able to select multiple lines by going into Visual Block mode with `Ctrl - v`. Then you can select multiple lines and delete them with d. Make a mistake? Undo with u. Redo? Ctrl - r.
