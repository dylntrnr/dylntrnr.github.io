Today I switched my old Jekyll blog over to a yeoman jekyll generator at https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb

It was pretty easy to get to work. Just follow the directions in the readme:

```
Wrapping an existing site in Yeoman isn't hard, but it takes a little manual editing.

1. Generate a new Yeoman/Jekyll app with the same tools and directory structure as your own. Ignore the templating options.
2. Transfer any custom configuration from your _config.yml to the newly generated _config.yml.
3. If you're using Compass, transfer custom configuration from your config.rb to the compass task in the Gruntfile.
4. Delete everything inside the Yeoman app directory.
5. Delete your site's original _config.yml, config.rb, and any files generated by Jekyll, CSS preprocessors, or CoffeeScript. Copy the remaining site into the app directory
6. Test that everything is working correctly by running grunt server, grunt dist, and grunt server:dist. Check that the files you expect are being transferred to the dist directory.
7. If you were versioning the _site directory, move its .git folder to the dist directory.
```

And then to build the site and have it run on github pages you need to:

```
grunt build
remove dist/ from .gitignore
git add dist && git commit -m "adding dist"
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages [or master for user/org]
```
